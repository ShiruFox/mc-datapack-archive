# Individual keepInventory

Use `execute as <PLAYNERNAME> function keepinv:keepinvon`to turn on keepInventory for only that person (more or less) - doesn't work if the person falls into the void, heavy lag might also interfere
In the same manner use `/execute as <PLAYNERNAME> run function keepinv:keepinvoff` to turn keepInventory off for that person
