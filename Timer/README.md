Timers

(When you execute `/function settimer:<05minutes/10minutes/15minutes/.../55minutes/60minutes>` a timer of that time is created as a blue bossbar. You are informed when the timer passes 5 minutes, 2:30 minutes and when it's over. The bossbar becomes yellow on 5 minutes, red on 2:30 minutees and disappears again when the timer is over.)
